# HackTheHightsRefactor

Taking the incomplete project from: https://github.com/Happyyguyy/HackTheHeights2018 and completing it.

this project is a Q&A forum type framework implementing google firebase as a backend database. it incorporates heavily client side js to make the site interactive. most of it is spagetti code due to the lack of understanding of how asynchronous code works. that said... i don't want to fix any of the spagetti code because its a nightmare to look at.
